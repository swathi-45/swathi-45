## 🚀 Professional Overview
I am a cybersecurity enthusiast transitioning into the Blue Team space with a focus on **Detection Engineering** and **Windows Log Analysis**. I specialize in bridging the gap between offensive techniques (CEH v13 mindset) and defensive monitoring using Splunk and MITRE ATT&CK.

* 🔭 **Current Focus:** Advanced Log Correlation & Sigma Rules
* 🛡️ **Certifications:** Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH v13)
* ⚡ **Fun Fact:** I spend my free time breaking things in my lab just to see what the logs look like.
